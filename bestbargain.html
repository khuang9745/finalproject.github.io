        <main>
            <p>Between paying tuition, rent, and the abundance of parking tickets I have accumuated, living on a budget is a skill many of us have adapted
               and mastered at our time here at the University of Michigan. Therefore, I have racked up a list of my favorite meals on a budget, including
               some restaurants outside of Ann Arbor if we do venture out.
            </p>
            <p>
               First on the list we have the classic Pancherous on South U. For the price of $8 you can get a large burrito filled to the brim with many of
               their various offerings, and even as a self-proclaimed glutton I always find myself full to the point of near-nausea when consuming their foods.
