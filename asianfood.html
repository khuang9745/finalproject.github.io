          <p>If I had to pick a favorite cuisine, it would have to be Asian. While this umbrella term categorizes many different cultures and tastes,
             I feel as though my tastebuds align with many of the flavors found in all the countries of Asia.

              Madras Masalas is a small, South Indian and Indo-Chinese inspired restaurant located on Maynard St. in Ann Arbor. With
              a small and unassuming storefront which can easily be missed on a busy street, this hidden gem has some of the best curries
              I have ever eaten. If the day is cold or I just need to reward myself, I'll get the Lamb Saag and Fish Tikka Masala, which can
              either feed 3 people or 2 hungry ones. Rice is provided, but I always find myself needing more, which is why I like to order
              takeout and make some of my own to eat with all the delicious curry.
          </p>

            Totoro is a small Japanese sushi restaurant located in the heart of Ann Arbor's restaurant hub on S. State St. However, maybe
            I should rename this page to my favorite hidden gems because Totoro is even harder to find than Madras Masala. Located inside another
            building with no sign on the outside, it would be hard to come across this resturant unless one is specifically looking. The only 
            thing which might help is the long lines, always out the door in times I have gone. Below, you can see my girlfriend and I enjoying
            their $120 sushi party tray with my older brother and his girlfriend (both unpictured). While this particuar meal was expensive, Totoro
            also offers a variety of other dinner options, such as as udon, rice bowls, and assorted appetizers.
