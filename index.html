		<p>
			Welcome to my restuarant tour! I have compiled some of my favorite restaurants and foods
			all around Michigan. From my hometown in Novi to the streets of Ann Arbor, these include
			some of my favorite ethnic foods as well as some spots I have found to be the best
			bargain for college students. 

		</p>

		<p>
			For now, this page is under construction. But feel free to check back in during the semester
			to see what the new restaurants I add and the page come to life! (For the graders, Kevin's All
			Time Favorites is the page that holds 9 images)
