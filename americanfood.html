		<p>Compiled below are my favorite American resturants. American cuisine is much like American culture, often a melting pot of different
		   backgrounds andd ethnicities, and I hope to show off just how much culture and history there is behind our favorite foods. 
		</p>
		<p>
		   My first resturant is near and dear to my heart, IHOP. This resturant was a favorite of mine back in high school, and I would often
		   visit with a large group of friends late at night (or VERY early in the morning) due to them being open for 24 hours. While I can't 
		   describe the food as outstanding, IHOP has a nostalgic place in my heart and brings back fond memories. They have a classic american 
		   menu but specialize in all sorts of pancakes, so drop by if you have a craving for something sweet, day or night!
		   (One of these pictures doesn't quite seem in place. Hover over for a surprise!)
