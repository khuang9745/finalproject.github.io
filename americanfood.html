		<p>Compiled below are my favorite American resturants. American cuisine is much like American culture, often a melting pot of different
		   backgrounds andd ethnicities, and I hope to show off just how much culture and history there is behind our favorite foods. 
		</p>

		   My first resturant is near and dear to my heart, IHOP. This resturant was a favorite of mine back in high school, and I would often
		   visit with a large group of friends late at night (or VERY early in the morning) due to them being open for 24 hours.
