            <p>Here we have my all-time favorite places to eat at, including some of the best food I've ever had. You may think of this as Kevin's
               personal michelin guide.
            </p>
            <p>First off we having Slurping Turtle, located on E Liberty street close to campus. If you're looking for the perfect meal on a cold winters
               day, this is the place for you. With a variety of sushi and ramens to choose from, I've never been disappointed after a meal here. From a
               slupring trutle regular, I recommend the Duck Fat Fried Chicken ramen, with an extra side of noodles to soak up all the leftover broth
               after consuming all the crispy friend chicken and soft, gooey egg.
