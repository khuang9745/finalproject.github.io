            <h2>What is Congee?</h2>
            <p>
                Congee is a traditional chinese rice based dish with a porridge like texture. By cooking rice in lots of liquid,
                you are able to extend a cup of rice to feed more people. Originating as a peasant dish, congee is one of my ultimate
                comfort foods and instantly brings me back to my childhood. Often lacking in flavor, congee is made special with
                the variety of toppings available and can easily be customized and made with common ingredients in everybody's pantry.
